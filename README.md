# Initial Project Setup

1. Install Python version 3.10.13 and make sure it is being used in the following steps and later during development
   (it is recommended to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python versions management)

2. Install Poetry

```bash
export PIP_REQUIRED_VERSION=24.2
pip install pip==${PIP_REQUIRED_VERSION} && \
pip install virtualenvwrapper && \
pip install poetry==1.8.3 && \
poetry config virtualenvs.path ${HOME}/.virtualenvs && \
poetry run pip install pip==${PIP_REQUIRED_VERSION}
```

3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/thenewboston-Backend.git
```

4. Copy the settings templates into a new local directory:

```bash
mkdir -p local
cp thenewboston/project/settings/templates/settings.dev.py ./local/settings.dev.py
cp thenewboston/project/settings/templates/settings.unittests.py ./local/settings.unittests.py
```

5. Install / upgrade docker as described at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```bash
# Known working versions described in the comments below 

docker --version # Docker version 26.0.1, build d260a54

# (!!!) At least Docker Compose version v2.24.0 is required
docker compose version # Docker Compose version v2.26.1
```

6. Commands for setting up local environment. Run the following commands:

```bash
make run-dependencies  # Sets up the necessary Docker containers for Redis and PostgreSQL
make update            # Installs project dependencies, pre-commit and applies database migrations
```

7. Fire Up the Server ðŸš€

```bash
make run-server       # Starts the Django development server
```

8. Create a superuser and configure the initial data

```bash
make superuser        # Creates a Django superuser account
```

After creating the superuser, you need to set up some initial data:

1. Go to Django admin at http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Log in with your superuser credentials
3. Navigate to **Cores** and manually add a core with the ticker **TNB**
4. Navigate to **Invitation limits** and manually set an invitation limit for your superuser

Now you're all set! The backend is up and ready for action.


# Essential Developer Guidelines

To contribute effectively, follow these guidelines:

- Branch off (new branch) from `master` for new features or fixes.
- Do your work and run `make lint` to ensure code quality.
- Open a Pull Request (PR) for review.
- Wait for approval before merging to `master`. No direct pushes, please!
