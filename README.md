# Initial Project Setup

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/thenewboston-Backend.git
```

2. Copy the settings templates into a new local directory:

```bash
mkdir -p local
cp thenewboston/project/settings/templates/settings.dev.py ./local/settings.dev.py
cp thenewboston/project/settings/templates/settings.unittests.py ./local/settings.unittests.py
```

3. Install / upgrade docker as described at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```bash
# Known working versions described in the comments below 

docker --version # Docker version 26.0.1, build d260a54

# (!!!) At least Docker Compose version v2.24.0 is required
docker compose version # Docker Compose version v2.26.1
```

4. Commands for setting up local environment. Run the following commands:

```bash
make run-dependencies  # Sets up the necessary Docker containers for Redis and PostgreSQL
make update            # Installs project dependencies, pre-commit and applies database migrations
```

5. Fire Up the Server ðŸš€

```bash
make run-server       # Starts the Django development server
make run-celery       # Starts the Celery worker for background tasks and LLM chatbot
make run-celery-beat  # Starts the Celery Beat
```

Now you're all set! The backend is up and ready for action.


# Essential Developer Guidelines

To contribute effectively, follow these guidelines:

- Branch off (new branch) from `master` for new features or fixes.
- Do your work and run `make lint` to ensure code quality.
- Open a Pull Request (PR) for review.
- Wait for approval before merging to `master`. No direct pushes, please!
